TODO:
x add wrapper type to imports
x parity with old ABI
- use maps for unique def kinds
- use enums instead of strings
- JSON-schema
- Transpile to TS
- notes on things removed from old ABI (capabilities)
- compile the ts example files to make sure they implement the ABI well
- document the choices around imports & how import "routing" works for importing the imports of your import. (ex: "1.2.3")
- migration script from 0.1 to 0.2?

Test-Cases:
- referencing imports
- implemented interfaces

After Init PR:
- fix complex types

Future:
- "runtime abi" is a compressed hyper optimized ABI for small storage & download, and fast runtime traversal & introspection (hashes, etc)
- research merkle-root hashes for root-definitions (function, object, enum, etc?) to help with validation execution time
  - "does interface A implement interface B?"
